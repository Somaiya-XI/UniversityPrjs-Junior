# System Design (Entry-lvl) - Suggestions and Complaints SystemThis is a design for suggestions and complaints system that provides functionalities for a specific Uni students , academics, and any other staff who has this Uni's credentials . The system will allow the users to submit complaints or provide suggestions, then the admin will assign employees to handle these submissions, afterward it will get back to the user with the feedback about his own submission. This system is designed to serve for multiple universities so the admin and system staffs can be separate from the Uni's staff so that it can be extendible and more global.
