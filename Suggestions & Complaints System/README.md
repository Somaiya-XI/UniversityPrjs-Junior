# System Design (Entry-lvl) - Suggestions and Complaints System

## Project Description

This design document outlines a suggestions and complaints system tailored for university students, academics, and other staff with valid university credentials. The system will enable users to:
- Submit complaints or suggestions.
- Have submissions assigned to specific employees.
- Receive feedback about their submissions.

The system is designed to be extendible and applicable to multiple universities, allowing for separate administration and system staff management.
